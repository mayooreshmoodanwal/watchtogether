## Local Development

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# The defaults in .env.example use Metered.ca free STUN/TURN — works out of the box
```

### 3. Build Next.js
```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Start the server
```bash
npm start
# or for development with hot reload:
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in Chrome or Brave.

## Deploying to Render.com (Recommended — Free, supports WebSockets)

ANTP uses Socket.io with persistent WebSocket connections. **Render.com** is the easiest free host for this.

### Steps:
1. Push this repo to GitHub (make sure `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` — it already is)
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → New → Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Settings:
   - **Environment:** Node
   - **Build Command:** `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command:** `npm start`
5. Add Environment Variables in Render dashboard:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_URL` = `turn:openrelay.metered.ca:80`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_USERNAME` = `openrelayproject`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_CREDENTIAL` = `openrelayproject`
   - `NODE_ENV` = `production`
6. Deploy — Render gives you a public HTTPS URL like `https://antp.onrender.com`
7. Share that URL with friends — they join by entering the room code on the landing page.

## Deploying to Railway.app (Alternative Free Host)

1. Push repo to GitHub
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) → New Project → Deploy from GitHub
3. Add the same environment variables as above
4. Railway auto-detects Node.js and runs `npm start`
5. Get your public URL from the Railway dashboard

## Deploying to Vercel (Limited — read note)

> ⚠️ **Note:** Vercel's serverless platform has a 10-second timeout on functions and does not natively support persistent WebSocket connections. ANTP uses Socket.io which requires persistent connections. **Vercel works for demos/testing** but may drop connections under load. For production, use Render or Railway above.

If you still want Vercel:
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run `npm run build` first
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Run `vercel --prod`

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_URL` | TURN server URL | `turn:openrelay.metered.ca:80` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_USERNAME` | TURN username | `openrelayproject` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_CREDENTIAL` | TURN password | `openrelayproject` |
| `PORT` | Server port | `3000` |

The default TURN config uses the free [Open Relay Project](https://www.metered.ca/tools/openrelay/) by Metered.ca — no signup needed.
